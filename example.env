# SKILL CHANGES PAGE
# ===========================================
# The "Skills" page on the website displays custom skill modifications for each job.
# This data comes from the game server's API, which reads from:
#   swordie/src/main/java/net/swordie/ms/constants/SkillChangeConstants.java
#
# To update what's shown on the website:
#   1. Edit the getXxxSkillChangeString() methods in SkillChangeConstants.java
#   2. Rebuild/recompile the Swordie server
#   3. Restart the game server
#
# The website will then fetch the updated changes from the API.
